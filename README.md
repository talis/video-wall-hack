video-wall
==========

This repo was a Talis hackday project to set up a video wall. We had a bunch of ancient laptops in the cupboard plus a 1Gb switch, and we wanted to see if we could set up a 2x2 bank of screens to do various things:

* Show a desktop over the whole wall
* Show an HTML5 video over the whole wall
* Open a browser on single screens, on a round-robin basis

Thus, this repo contains several sub-projects in one: share-desktop, html5-video and browser-open. These are contained in seperate folders, and may be used individually.

The 2x2 size is not fixed, and could be changed for all of these approaches.
